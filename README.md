# Esri Leaflet

Leaflet plugins for [ArcGIS Services](http://developers.arcgis.com). Currently Esri Leaflet supports loading Esri [basemaps](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/switching-basemaps.html) and [feature services](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-feature-layer.html), as well as [tiled](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/tile-layer-2.html), [dynamic](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-dynamic-map-layer.html) and [image](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-image-map-layer.html)  map services.

The goal of Esri Leaflet is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/), but rather to provide small components to allow developers to build mapping applications with Leaflet.

**This repo is *just* the website (API Reference, examples and downloads).**
